Hey there — I'm Niels Plug, a developer with a passion for clean code, good design, and building useful things on the web.

This site is my digital playground. It's where I'll be documenting side projects, writing about things I'm learning, and sharing thoughts on development, design systems, and maybe even a bit of infrastructure work. I believe in building in public, so this blog is as much for me as it is for anyone who stumbles across it.

### What to Expect

In upcoming posts, I'll dive into:

- Projects I'm working on — including what went well and what didn't.
- Deep dives into tools and libraries I enjoy using (like Next.js, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, and more).
- Practical tips and small patterns I've found useful in TypeScript-heavy monorepos.

### Thanks for Being Here

If you're reading this — thank you. I'm excited to see where this goes, and I hope you find something helpful (or at least interesting) along the way.

Let's build cool things.

— Niels Plug
