Building my own portfolio was something I kept postponing — not because I didn't want one, but because I knew I'd get carried away with the details. And I did. But in the best way.

This site is where I showcase the things I build, experiment with tech I like, and write when I feel like sharing something. It's made to be mine — lightweight, flexible, and fully under my control.

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **Next.js (App Router)** — For routing, layouts, and server components.
- **MDX** — To write posts and project pages in Markdown, with React components when I need them.
- **shadcn/ui** — I use this for the whole design system. Clean components, great defaults, and Tailwind under the hood.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Handles layout, spacing, and theming.
- **next-themes** — Enables dark mode/light mode toggling.
- **Vercel** — Instant deploys, fast CDN, and it just works.

## 🎯 Why This Stack?

I didn't want a CMS or a bloated setup. I wanted to write `.mdx` files, push to my API and see the site update instantly. I also wanted full design control without rebuilding basic components — which is why `shadcn/ui` was a perfect match. It helped me focus on content and layout without getting stuck in design decisions. It's also super easy to customize and beautiful out of the box.

MDX also lets me treat content as code. If I ever want to drop in an interactive component inside a blog post or project, it's trivial.

## 🧪 Still a Work in Progress

I haven't added SEO or social previews yet — I'll get to that when I care enough. Right now, it's about getting my work out there and iterating as I go.

I'm constantly tweaking things behind the scenes, trying new layouts, or experimenting with new libraries. This portfolio is as much a playground as it is a showcase.
