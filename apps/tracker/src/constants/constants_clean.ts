	SUMMARY:
		"Welcome to Repulse: the slightly sarcastic strength-tracking sidekick you didn't know you needed. Log workouts, rack up streaks, stalk your own progress, and casually obliterate your friends on the leaderboard. This isn't a fitness app. It's a mission log.",
	DESCRIPTION: `
    Meet Repulse, a workout tracker with just enough attitude to call you out when you skip leg day. From daily grind to PR glory, this dashboard is your hub for stats, streaks, and subtle flexes.

    Built with Next.js, styled sharp with shadcn/ui, and secured by BetterAuth (because gains are sacred). You bring the sweat, Repulse brings the stats.

    Disclaimer: Using Repulse may result in excessive competitiveness, muscle soreness, and smug screenshots. Proceed like a hero.`,
